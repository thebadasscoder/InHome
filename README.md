## Goal

To build out a web experience where it was not only clean but intuitive for the user. I found joy in designing out this app because it allowed me to create something where it would trigger inspiration for any user to use. 


## Beyond MVP

Beyond the MVP of this challenge, I thought it would have been cool to build the following features in the future: 

* Notifications (Desktop & Mobile) - Added to the dashboard where the users can be notified about the status of an order.

* Search Engine - Where it allows users to lookup an order more quickly.  

* Chatbot - Where it allows users to easily communicate with customers in real time about their orders.

* Profile Page - An add-on to the dashboard for users can personalize their profiles to be seen by their other team members.
