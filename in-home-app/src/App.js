import React from 'react';
// import Signup from './components/signup.js'; 
// import Navbar from './components/navbar.js';
import Dashboard from './components/dashboard.js';

function App() {
  return (
    <div className="grid-container">
      <Dashboard/>
    </div>
  );
}
export default App;


//Note: Due to me experiencing an error with react-router and being pressed for time, I was unable to assign each component to a separate page. The Sign Up Component and NavBar Component is what makes up the Signup/SignIn Page that I designed for the app.
